How I setup and run dwm under Ubuntu.

SETUP
=====

1. Run ./setup to install all the packages, including the prebuilt version of dwm.
   We won't actually run the prebuilt version, but it sets up some other nice stuff.

2. Create /usr/share/dwm/ and copy startdwm into it.

3. Use dwm_start.desktop as a template for /usr/share/xsession/joe.desktop.
  The joe.desktop file will give you a login option to use dwm as your window
  manager.

4. Download dwm source, apply dwm_patches to the source then:

   $ sudo make clean install

5. Logout and when logging back in select Joe Dwm as your login shell.

6. Restarts just restart dwm and don't launch all the background tasks again.

7. The system tray, as provided by trayer, is only available on screen 1 and screen 0.

NX
==

If you are running NX then you need to edit this config file:

  /usr/NX/etc/node.cfg

And add dwm as one of the shell options, I use CDE:

  #
  # Specify path and name of the command starting 'CDE'.
  #
  CommandStartCDE = "/usr/share/dwm/startdwm"
